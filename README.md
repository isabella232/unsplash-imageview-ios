# UnsplashImageView
A `UIImageView` subclass that displays a random photo from Unsplash.

## Installation
Download and copy `UnsplashImageView.swift` to your project. If you prefer, you can always use `git submodule`.

### Carthage
You donâ€™t need a framework for a single file, move along.

### CocoaPods
Press Command+W right now.

## Usage
First, you need an Unsplash API access key. Visit our [Unsplash API page](https://unsplash.com/developers) to register as a developer for more information.

Once you have the access key, you can use `UnsplashImageView` either in Interface Builder or your code, like a UIImageView. To fetch a new photo, call the `fetchPhoto()` function.

### Settings
* `accessKey`: The API access key for your app.
* `query`: Search terms if you want to display photos around a specific topic.
* `imageURL`: This property is set once a photo is fetched and displayed, you can store this value somewhere, to re-use later.

## Notes
* Images are cached in memory (up to 50MB) and on disk (up to 100MB).
* If you want to display a placeholder image while it is fetching, set it on the `image` property, it will be replaced by the fetched photo.
